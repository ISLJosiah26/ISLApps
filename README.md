# Social Post Intelligence (Apple-style UI)

A sleek, modern web app that lets you upload and compare **multiple social posts** at once.

## What changed

- Replaced fixed “low-performing vs high-performing” mode with a **dynamic card system**.
- Add as many posts as you want, then analyze all together.
- Per-post inputs are now exactly what you asked for:
  - Post image upload
  - Caption
  - Platform
  - Post type
  - Likes
  - Comments
  - Impressions
  - Engagements
  - Post date
  - Post time
- AI now auto-estimates from caption text:
  - Hook quality score (1–10)
  - CTA strength score (1–10)
- Results are written in a **conversational style**, plus ranked comparisons and recommended actions.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click **Add Post** to create cards.
3. Fill each post card (and optionally upload images).
4. Click **Analyze All Posts**.
5. Review:
   - Top performer summary
   - Conversational AI explanation
   - Post-by-post comparison
   - Recommended next actions
